# Balancedview
Customized news search engine providing both positive and negative views on any topic

Objective:
News search application which provides both positive and negative views on along with sentiment score.
The tool will provide users to access both sides (positive and negative) news / opinions at the same time enabling
them to make more informed and balanced choices.

The tool will list articles with the maximum divergence from mean in their sentiment score and rank them in decending order.

Background:
Given the increasingly polarised world and personalised search (based on user profiles / search history), we are
increasingly accessing information in our own bubbles based on either our political preferences, subscriptions etc.
This then becomes a feedback loop which feeds on itself causing further polarisation leading to extreme views. The
impact of this is further enhanced with the advent of fake news.
Using this project, we aim to provide users with a balanced platform which will source views from both sides (positive
and negative) at one place. So, the users can compare notes and make a more informed balanced judgement on any
given topic.
